\section{Introduction to Machine Learning}


Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. \\

Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. \\

\subsection{Supervised Learning}


In \textbf{supervised learning}, the "right answers" are known.\\

A \textbf{Regression} is predicting a value! For example Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture\\

A \textbf{classification} is breaking into groups or discrete values.  For example Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.\\


\subsection{Unsupervised Learning}

In \textbf{unsupervised learning}, the "right answers" are \textbf{not} known.\\

Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.\\

We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.\\

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results. \\

\subsection{Model}

Input variables or input features are denoted as $x^{(i)}$\\
Output or target variable we are trying to predict are denoted as $y^{(i)}$\\
The pair $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ is called a training example.
