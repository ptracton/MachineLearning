* Linear Regression

- Relationship between 2 continuous variables. The relation between 1 dependent variable and 1 or more indepdent variables.
- Fits into below equation
$$ Y = aX + b $$
- Best fitting (minimize SSE predictions) the straight line is called "Regression Line"
- SSE is the measure of difference between data and mean

** Logistic Regression
- Mainly used for binary classification, but can be used for multi
- Model coefficient values gives us the probability that the variable belongs to whchi class, among given classes
- Threshold of assigning the probability can be adjusted owing to our requirements.

** SVM
- Support Vector Machines
- Useful for multi-classification (>2 targets)
- Given several parameters, figure out which item it is
- Select optimal hyperplane
- Maximum margin to be present while seperating the hyperplane
- Support Vectors: data points closest to separating hyperplane
