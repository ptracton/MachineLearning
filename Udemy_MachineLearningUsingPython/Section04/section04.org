* Section 04 Classifier and Python Package
** Decision Tree Classifier
- Tree like structure
- Splits data as a binary classifier into smaller and smaller subsets to predict accuracy
- Primary fields include Entopy and Information Gain
** Random Forest Classification
- Ensemble classification method, uses multiple classifiers to arrive at target
- for highly correlated predicaton and to assess future importance
- Two types of feature importance measement are Gini and Permutation
- Not suitable for higher dimensional data sinc ethe tree get sply less number of relevant features.
** K Mean Clustering
- Unsupervised algorithm
- K-means++ to speed up data points convergence while initializing the cluster's center
- Based on Lloyd's Algorithm- Iterate through the model to get static cluster center; minimize the distance between the cluster mean to the data points present in n-dimensional space.
- Number of ways to determine optimal k value
** Apriori Python Package
*** Algorithm
- Degrees of associations
- Five primary fields that come up with Apriori are given as:
  - Base Item
  - Append Item
  - Support
  - Confidence
  - Lift
